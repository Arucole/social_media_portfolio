          <p>
            The business brand faced the problem of reaching the general public.
            The inability to archive desired goals and objectives as a result of
            no visibility and inability to connect to the general public was a
            problem. The Covid-19 times offered the opportunity for businesses
            to herness the benefits of Social Media like never before fostering
            a strong online presence. This was why I wanted to tackle the
            challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            I joined a team to manage the brands presence across different
            social media platforms. The group and I reported to the owner of the
            business and was overseen by the owner. I was responsible for the
            social media management and user-generated content management.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the experience was long, I was extremely fortunate for the
            experience and
            <span
              >I got to implement my strategy of community building and
              management organically and via sponsored adverts</span
            >. Some key achievements are listed below;
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Implemented a successful strategy to solve the problem. I was able
              to experience first-hand the implementation of a process to solve
              a problem presented. Initiated meetings with the business owner
              brought forward the problem of the brand awareness and reach. I
              was involved in the process of strategy formation by brainstorming
              through consistent WhatsApp messaging. liasing with the business
              owner and weekly meetings & analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Established a collaborative team-working process. I was able to
              levrage my previous social media experience and extensive academic
              knowledge while also learning from the other members. working
              within a collaborative, highly creative and innovative team was
              truely an amazing experience
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed trusting relationships with owner. Throughout the
              experience I worked closely with the business owner.
              <span
                >I showcased Consistency and dependability and developed a
                professional and trusting relationship</span

          <h3>Understanding The Problem</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="abjProblems">
          <p>
            I actively listened, asked questions and took notes in the first
            initial meeting (2 weeks in) with the business owner and I concluded
            the problem faced were low followership and social media presence,
            brand awareness and instagram reach.
          </p>
          <p>Using my experience I suggested the following;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The power of social Media grew exponetially and online traffic
              increased worldwide due to lockdown. This meant there was
              opportunity for growth and success for the brand awareness.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leverage partnerships and sponsored adverts for exclusive special
              offers increasing reach greatly(1,000 - 15,000 followers) building
              trust for the brand
            </li>
            <li>
              User-generated content encourages followers to interact and engage
              while also encouraging others to share content.
